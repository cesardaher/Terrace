You: I feel like a plant. A plant whose roots have been cut. 
And now I am neither sure where I belong nor how to continue growing. 
You: Maybe she has even been my roots all along. 
You: I do not know. I feel confused. Confused, tired and cold. 
You: It is the best for me to go to bed now, tomorrow is another day. I am missing you.

You: I remember helping her watering the plants, painting the walls or feeding the birds.

You: I really admire their ability to fly away as soon as things get overwhelming.
You: Hey, I think you forgot something! Or maybe you want to give something to me?

You: What are the chances! This has to mean something. 
You: Perhaps it can be a new start for this place here. Hm, I should take a closer look at this environment.
